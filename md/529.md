A *10-substring* of a number is a substring of its digits that sum to
10. For example, the 10-substrings of the number 3523014 are:

-   **352**3014
-   3**523**014
-   3**5230**14
-   35**23014**

A number is called *10-substring-friendly* if every one of its digits
belongs to a 10-substring. For example, 3523014 is
10-substring-friendly, but 28546 is not.

Let T(n) be the number of 10-substring-friendly numbers from 1 to 10^n^
(inclusive).\
 For example T(2) = 9 and T(5) = 3492.

Find T(10^18^) mod 1 000 000 007.
