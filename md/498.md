For positive integers n and m, we define two polynomials F~n~(x) = x^n^
and G~m~(x) = (x-1)^m^.\
 We also define a polynomial R~n,m~(x) as the remainder of the division
of F~n~(x) by G~m~(x).\
 For example, R~6,3~(x) = 15x^2^ - 24x + 10.

Let C(n, m, d) be the absolute value of the coefficient of the d-th
degree term of R~n,m~(x).\
 We can verify that C(6, 3, 1) = 24 and C(100, 10, 4) = 227197811615775.

Find C(10^13^, 10^12^, 10^4^) mod 999999937.
