The **Thue-Morse sequence** {T~n~} is a binary sequence satisfying:

-   T~0~ = 0
-   T~2n~ = T~n~
-   T~2n+1~ = 1 - T~n~

The first several terms of {T~n~} are given as follows:\
 01101001100101101001011001101001....

We define {A~n~} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary
expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {T~n~}.\
 For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary.
10010 appears in {T~n~} (T~8~ to T~12~), so 18 is an element of {A~n~}.\
 The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never
appears in {T~n~}, so 14 is not an element of {A~n~}.

The first several terms of A~n~ are given as follows:\

  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  n    A~n~
  0    0
  1    1
  2    2
  3    3
  4    4
  5    5
  6    6
  7    9
  8    10
  9    11
  10   12
  11   13
  12   18
  …    …
  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

We can also verify that A~100~ = 3251 and A~1000~ = 80852364498.
