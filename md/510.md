Circles A and B are tangent to each other and to line L at three
distinct points.\
 Circle C is inside the space between A, B and L, and tangent to all
three.\
 Let r~A~, r~B~ and r~C~ be the radii of A, B and C respectively.\

Let S(n) = Σ r~A~ + r~B~ + r~C~, for 0 \< r~A~ ≤ r~B~ ≤ n where r~A~,
r~B~ and r~C~ are integers. The only solution for 0 \< r~A~ ≤ r~B~ ≤ 5
is r~A~ = 4, r~B~ = 4 and r~C~ = 1, so S(5) = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. You are
also given S(100) = 3072.

Find S(10^9^).
