Let f~k~(n) be the sum of the k^th^ powers of the first n positive
integers.

For example, f~2~(10) = 1^2^ + 2^2^ + 3^2^ + 4^2^ + 5^2^ + 6^2^ + 7^2^ +
8^2^ + 9^2^ + 10^2^ = 385.

Let S~k~(n) be the sum of f~k~(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For example, S~4~(100)
= 35375333830.

What is ∑ (S~10000~(10^12^) mod p) over all primes p between 2 ⋅ 10^9^
and 2 ⋅ 10^9^ + 2000?
