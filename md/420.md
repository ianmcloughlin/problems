A *positive integer matrix* is a matrix whose elements are all positive
integers.\
 Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a
positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which
have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a
positive integer matrix in two different ways.\
 We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.

Find F(10^7^).
