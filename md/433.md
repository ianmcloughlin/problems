Let E(x~0~, y~0~) be the number of steps it takes to determine the
greatest common divisor of x~0~ and y~0~ with **Euclid's algorithm**.
More formally:\
x~1~ = y~0~, y~1~ = x~0~ mod y~0~\
x~n~ = y~n-1~, y~n~ = x~n-1~ mod y~n-1~\
 E(x~0~, y~0~) is the smallest n such that y~n~ = 0.

We have E(1,1) = 1, E(10,6) = 3 and E(6,10) = 4.

Define S(N) as the sum of E(x,y) for 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.\
 We have S(1) = 1, S(10) = 221 and S(100) = 39826.

Find S(5·10^6^).
