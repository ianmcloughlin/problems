ABCD is a convex, integer sided quadrilateral with 1 ≤ AB \< BC \< CD \<
AD.\
 BD has integer length. O is the midpoint of BD. AO has integer length.\
 We'll call ABCD a *biclinic integral quadrilateral* if AO = CO ≤ BO =
DO.\

For example, the following quadrilateral is a biclinic integral
quadrilateral:\
 AB = 19, BC = 29, CD = 37, AD = 43, BD = 48 and AO = CO = 23.

Let B(N) be the number of distinct biclinic integral quadrilaterals ABCD
that satisfy AB^2^+BC^2^+CD^2^+AD^2^ ≤ N.\
 We can verify that B(10 000) = 49 and B(1 000 000) = 38239.

Find B(10 000 000 000).
