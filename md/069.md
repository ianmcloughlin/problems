Euler's Totient function, φ(*n*) [sometimes called the phi function], is
used to determine the number of numbers less than *n* which are
relatively prime to *n*. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all
less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

It can be seen that *n*=6 produces a maximum *n*/φ(*n*) for *n* ≤ 10.

Find the value of *n* ≤ 1,000,000 for which *n*/φ(*n*) is a maximum.
