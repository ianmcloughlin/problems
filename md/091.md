The points P (*x*~1~, *y*~1~) and Q (*x*~2~, *y*~2~) are plotted at
integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can
be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that
is,\
0 ≤ *x*~1~, *y*~1~, *x*~2~, *y*~2~ ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ *x*~1~, *y*~1~, *x*~2~, *y*~2~ ≤ 50, how many right
triangles can be formed?
