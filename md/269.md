A root or zero of a polynomial P(x) is a solution to the equation P(x) =
0.\
 Define P~n~ as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of n.\
 For example, P~5703~(x) = 5x^3^ + 7x^2^ + 3.

We can see that:

-   P~n~(0) is the last digit of n,
-   P~n~(1) is the sum of the digits of n,
-   P~n~(10) is n itself.

Define Z(k) as the number of positive integers, n, not exceeding k for
which the polynomial P~n~ has at least one integer root.

It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.

What is Z(10^16^)?
