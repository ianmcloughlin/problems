Let a~k~, b~k~, and c~k~ represent the three solutions (real or complex
numbers) to the expression 1/x = (k/x)^2^(k+x^2^) - kx.

For instance, for k = 5, we see that {a~5~, b~5~, c~5~} is approximately
{5.727244, -0.363622+2.057397i, -0.363622-2.057397i}.

Let S(n) = Σ (a~k~+b~k~)^p^(b~k~+c~k~)^p^(c~k~+a~k~)^p^ for all integers
p, k such that 1 ≤ p, k ≤ n.

Interestingly, S(n) is always an integer. For example, S(4) = 51160.

Find S(10^6^) modulo 1 000 000 007.
