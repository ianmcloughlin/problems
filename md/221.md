We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there
exist integers p, q, r such that:

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| A = p · q |
| · r       |
|    and    |
|   --- --- |
|   1       |
|   --- --- |
|           |
| =         |
|   --- --- |
|   1       |
|   --- --- |
|           |
| +         |
|   --- --- |
|   1       |
|   --- --- |
|           |
| +         |
|   --- --- |
|   1       |
|   --- --- |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer (p = 5, q = −7, r = −18). In
fact, 630 is the 6^th^ Alexandrian integer, the first 6 Alexandrian
integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420 and 630.

Find the 150000^th^ Alexandrian integer.
