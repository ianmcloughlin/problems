### Problem 53

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, ^5^C~3~ = 10.

In general,

  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
  ^n^C~r~ =
  n!\
  r!(n−r)!
  ,where r ≤ n, n! =
  n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and
  0! = 1.
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: ^23^C~10~ =
1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  ^n^C~r~, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,
are greater than one-million?
