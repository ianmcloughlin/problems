Lenticular holes
----------------

### Problem 295

Published on Saturday, 5th June 2010, 01:00 pm; Solved by 333;
Difficulty rating: 75%

We call the convex area enclosed by two circles a *lenticular hole* if:

-   The centres of both circles are on lattice points.
-   The two circles intersect at two distinct lattice points.
-   The interior of the convex area enclosed by both circles does not
    contain any lattice points.

Consider the circles:\
 C~0~: x^2^+y^2^=25\
 C~1~: (x+4)^2^+(y-4)^2^=1\
 C~2~: (x-12)^2^+(y-4)^2^=65

The circles C~0~, C~1~ and C~2~ are drawn in the picture below.

C~0~ and C~1~ form a lenticular hole, as well as C~0~ and C~2~.

We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers (r~1~, r~2~) a
*lenticular pair* if there exist two circles with radii r~1~ and r~2~
that form a lenticular hole. We can verify that (1, 5) and (5, √65) are
the lenticular pairs of the example above.

Let L(N) be the number of **distinct** lenticular pairs (r~1~, r~2~) for
which 0 \< r~1~ ≤ r~2~ ≤ N.\
 We can verify that L(10) = 30 and L(100) = 3442.

Find L(100 000).
