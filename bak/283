Integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratio is integral
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Problem 283

Published on Friday, 19th March 2010, 09:00 pm; Solved by 452;
Difficulty rating: 70%

Consider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen that the
perimeter and the area are both equal to 24. So the area/perimeter ratio
is equal to 1.\
 Consider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter
equals 42 while the area is equal to 84. So for this triangle the
area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all integer sided triangles for which
the area/perimeter ratios are equal to positive integers not exceeding
1000.
