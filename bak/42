Coded triangle numbers
----------------------

### Problem 42

Published on Friday, 25th April 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 49758;
Difficulty rating: 5%

The *n*^th^ term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, *t~n~*
= Â½*n*(*n*+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = *t*~10~. If the
word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle
word.

Using [words.txt](project/resources/p042_words.txt) (right click and
'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly
two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
