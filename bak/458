Published on Sunday, 9th February 2014, 07:00 am; Solved by 440;
Difficulty rating: 30%

Consider the alphabet A made out of the letters of the word "project":
A={c,e,j,o,p,r,t}.\
 Let T(n) be the number of strings of length n consisting of letters
from A that do not have a substring that is one of the 5040 permutations
of "project".

T(7)=7^7^-7!=818503.

Find T(10^12^). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
