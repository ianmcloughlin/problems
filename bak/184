Triangles containing the origin
-------------------------------

### Problem 184

Published on Friday, 29th February 2008, 09:00 pm; Solved by 1045;
Difficulty rating: 75%

Consider the set I~r~ of points (x,y) with integer co-ordinates in the
interior of the circle with radius r, centered at the origin, i.e. x^2^
+ y^2^ \< r^2^.

For a radius of 2, I~2~ contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1),
(0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight
triangles having all three vertices in I~2~ which contain the origin in
the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from
these by rotation.

For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the
interior and having all vertices in I~3~ and for I~5~ the number is
10600.

How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and
having all three vertices in I~105~?
