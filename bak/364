### Problem 364

Published on Saturday, 24th December 2011, 01:00 pm; Solved by 425;
Difficulty rating: 50%

There are N seats in a row. N people come after each other to fill the
seats according to the following rules:

1.  If there is any seat whose adjacent seat(s) are not occupied take
    such a seat.
2.  If there is no such seat and there is any seat for which only one
    adjacent seat is occupied take such a seat.
3.  Otherwise take one of the remaining available seats.

Let T(N) be the number of possibilities that N seats are occupied by N
people with the given rules.\
 The following figure shows T(4)=8.

We can verify that T(10) = 61632 and T(1 000) mod 100 000 007 =
47255094.

Find T(1 000 000) mod 100 000 007.
