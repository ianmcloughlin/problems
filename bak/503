### Problem 503

Published on Saturday, 14th February 2015, 07:00 pm; Solved by 192;
Difficulty rating: 60%

Alice is playing a game with n cards numbered 1 to n.

A game consists of iterations of the following steps.\
 (1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.\
 (2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her
friends, sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen
numbers are bigger than the number which he is seeing.\
 (3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the
number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is
removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left,
she is forced to end the game.\

Let F(n) be the Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized
strategy to **minimize** her score.

For example, F(3) = 5/3. At the first iteration, she should continue the
game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says that
one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is seeing,
otherwise she should continue the game.

We can also verify that F(4) = 15/8 and F(10) â‰ˆ 2.5579365079.

Find F(10^6^). Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places behind the
decimal point.
