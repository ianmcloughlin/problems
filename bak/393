Migrating ants
--------------

### Problem 393

Published on Saturday, 8th September 2012, 05:00 pm; Solved by 465;
Difficulty rating: 50%

An n√ón grid of squares contains n^2^ ants, one ant per square.\
 All ants decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually 4
possibilities, except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the
corners).\
 We define f(n) to be the number of ways this can happen without any
ants ending on the same square and without any two ants crossing the
same edge between two squares.

You are given that f(4) = 88.\
 Find f(10).
