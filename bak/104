Pandigital Fibonacci ends
-------------------------

### Problem 104

Published on Friday, 9th September 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 10886;
Difficulty rating: 25%

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> F~*n*~ = F~*n*−1~ + F~*n*−2~, where F~1~ = 1 and F~2~ = 1.

It turns out that F~541~, which contains 113 digits, is the first
Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital
(contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And
F~2749~, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for
which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

Given that F~*k*~ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine
digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find *k*.
