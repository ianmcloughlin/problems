Scoring probabilities
---------------------

### Problem 286

Published on Saturday, 3rd April 2010, 05:00 am; Solved by 1407;
Difficulty rating: 45%

Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that
the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is
exactly (1 - ^x^/~q~), where q is a real constant greater than 50.

During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2,
..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 %
chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.

Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
