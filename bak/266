Pseudo Square Root
------------------

### Problem 266

Published on Saturday, 28th November 2009, 01:00 pm; Solved by 1127;
Difficulty rating: 65%

The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.\
 The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is
3.\
 We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed
the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.\
 It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.

Let p be the product of the primes below 190.\
 Find PSR(p) mod 10^16^.
