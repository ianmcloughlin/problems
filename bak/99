Largest exponential

### Problem 99

Published on Friday, 1st July 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 20337;
Difficulty rating: 10%

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11^ and 3^7^ is not
difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2^11^ = 2048 \< 3^7^ =
2187.

However, confirming that 632382^518061^ \> 519432^525806^ would be much
more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base\_exp.txt](project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt) (right click
and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand
lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line
number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the
example given above.
