### Problem 136

Published on Friday, 29th December 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 3632;
Difficulty rating: 50%

The positive integers, *x*, *y*, and *z*, are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression. Given that *n* is a positive integer, the
equation, *x*^2^ − *y*^2^ − *z*^2^ = *n*, has exactly one solution when
*n* = 20:

13^2^ − 10^2^ − 7^2^ = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of *n* below one hundred for which
the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of *n* less than fifty million have exactly one
solution?
