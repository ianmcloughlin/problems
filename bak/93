Arithmetic expressions

### Problem 93

Published on Friday, 15th April 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7420;
Difficulty rating: 35%

By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once,
and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, \*, /) and
brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer
targets.

For example,

8 = (4 \* (1 + 3)) / 2\
 14 = 4 \* (3 + 1 / 2)\
 19 = 4 \* (2 + 3) − 1\
 36 = 3 \* 4 \* (2 + 1)

Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one
different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the
numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first
non-expressible number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, *a* \< *b* \< *c* \< *d*, for
which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to *n*, can be
obtained, giving your answer as a string: *abcd*.
