### Problem 134

Published on Friday, 15th December 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 4598;
Difficulty rating: 45%

Consider the consecutive primes *p*~1~ = 19 and *p*~2~ = 23. It can be
verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are
formed by *p*~1~ whilst also being divisible by *p*~2~.

In fact, with the exception of *p*~1~ = 3 and *p*~2~ = 5, for every pair
of consecutive primes, *p*~2~ \> *p*~1~, there exist values of *n* for
which the last digits are formed by *p*~1~ and *n* is divisible by
*p*~2~. Let *S* be the smallest of these values of *n*.

Find ∑ *S* for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ *p*~1~ ≤
1000000.
