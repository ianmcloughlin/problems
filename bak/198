Ambiguous Numbers
-----------------

### Problem 198

Published on Saturday, 14th June 2008, 02:00 am; Solved by 696;
Difficulty rating: 80%

A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a
rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s â‰¤ d, so that any rational
number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q \> d.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined
for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g.
9/40 has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator
bound 6. We shall call a real number x *ambiguous*, if there is at least
one denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations.
Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.

How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 \< x \< 1/100, are there whose
denominator q does not exceed 10^8^?
