Sum square difference

### Problem 6

Published on Friday, 14th December 2001, 06:00 pm; Solved by 299555;
Difficulty rating: 5%

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2^ + 2^2^ + ... + 10^2^ = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2^ = 55^2^ = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
