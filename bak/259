Reachable Numbers
-----------------

### Problem 259

Published on Saturday, 10th October 2009, 01:00 pm; Solved by 1048;
Difficulty rating: 70%

A positive integer will be called *reachable* if it can result from an
arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:

-   Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.
-   Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the
    digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).
-   Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.
-   Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.
-   Unary minus is not allowed.
-   Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define
    the order of operations.

For example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) \* ((4\*5)-6) \* (78-9) = 42.

What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?
