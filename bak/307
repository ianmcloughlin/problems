Chip Defects
------------

### Problem 307

Published on Sunday, 24th October 2010, 10:00 am; Solved by 1009;
Difficulty rating: 35%

k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips
produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and
each defect is independent of the other defects).

Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least
3 defects.\
 For instance p(3,7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.

Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal
places in the form 0.abcdefghij
