Integer right triangles
-----------------------

### Problem 39

Published on Friday, 14th March 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 47562;
Difficulty rating: 5%

If *p* is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
sides, {*a*,*b*,*c*}, there are exactly three solutions for *p* = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of *p* â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
