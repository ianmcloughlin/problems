Licence plates
--------------

### Problem 371

Published on Sunday, 12th February 2012, 10:00 am; Solved by 932;
Difficulty rating: 30%

Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit
number (each digit can be from [0..9]).\
 While driving to work Seth plays the following game:\
 Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000
that's a win.

E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long
as he sees them in the same trip).

Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.\
 Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

**Note:** We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to
have any three digit number on it.
