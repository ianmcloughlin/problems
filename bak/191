Prize Strings
-------------

### Problem 191

Published on Saturday, 26th April 2008, 01:00 am; Solved by 4915;
Difficulty rating: 35%

A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance
and punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late
on more than one occasion then they forfeit their prize.

During an n-day period a trinary string is formed for each child
consisting of L's (late), O's (on time), and A's (absent).

Although there are eighty-one trinary strings for a 4-day period that
can be formed, exactly forty-three strings would lead to a prize:

OOOO OOOA OOOL OOAO OOAA OOAL OOLO OOLA OAOO OAOA\
 OAOL OAAO OAAL OALO OALA OLOO OLOA OLAO OLAA AOOO\
 AOOA AOOL AOAO AOAA AOAL AOLO AOLA AAOO AAOA AAOL\
 AALO AALA ALOO ALOA ALAO ALAA LOOO LOOA LOAO LOAA\
 LAOO LAOA LAAO

How many "prize" strings exist over a 30-day period?
