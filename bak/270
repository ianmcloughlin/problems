Cutting Squares
---------------

### Problem 270

Published on Saturday, 26th December 2009, 01:00 am; Solved by 452;
Difficulty rating: 80%

A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a
corner at the origin and two of its sides along the x- and y-axes. Then,
we cut it up respecting the following rules:

-   We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different
    sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.
-   Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border
    point.
-   Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.

Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the
number of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30
(shown below).

What is C(30) mod 10^8^ ?
