Palindromic sums
----------------

### Problem 125

Published on Friday, 4th August 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 9154;
Difficulty rating: 25%

The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as
the sum of consecutive squares: 6^2^ + 7^2^ + 8^2^ + 9^2^ + 10^2^ +
11^2^ + 12^2^.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be
written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is
4164. Note that 1 = 0^2^ + 1^2^ has not been included as this problem is
concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10^8^ that are both
palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
