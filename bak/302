Strong Achilles Numbers
-----------------------

### Problem 302

Published on Saturday, 18th September 2010, 07:00 pm; Solved by 478;
Difficulty rating: 60%

A positive integer n is **powerful** if p^2^ is a divisor of n for every
prime factor p in n.

A positive integer n is a **perfect power** if n can be expressed as a
power of another positive integer.

A positive integer n is an **Achilles number** if n is powerful but not
a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 =
2^5^·3^3^ and 1800 = 2^3^·3^2^·5^2^.

We shall call a positive integer S a *Strong Achilles number* if both S
and φ(S) are Achilles numbers.^1^\
 For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: φ(864) = 288 = 2^5^·3^2^.
However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: φ(1800) = 480 =
2^5^·3^1^·5^1^.

There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 10^4^ and 656 below 10^8^.

How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 10^18^?

^1^ φ denotes **Euler's totient function**.
