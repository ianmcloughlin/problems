Totient permutation
-------------------

### Problem 70

Published on Friday, 21st May 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 14515;
Difficulty rating: 20%

Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is
used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n
which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8,
are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.\
The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive
number, so φ(1)=1.

Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a
permutation of 79180.

Find the value of n, 1 \< n \< 10^7^, for which φ(n) is a permutation of
n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.
