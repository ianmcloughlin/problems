Amazing Mazes!
--------------

### Problem 380

Published on Saturday, 14th April 2012, 02:00 pm; Solved by 348;
Difficulty rating: 60%

An m×n maze is an m×n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid
cells such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to
any other square.\
The following are examples of a 9×12 maze and a 15×20 maze:

Let C(m,n) be the number of distinct m×n mazes. Mazes which can be
formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered
distinct.

It can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and
C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant
digits).\
 Find C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to
5 significant digits.

When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and
exponent. E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format
would be 1.2346e12.
