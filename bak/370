Geometric triangles
-------------------

### Problem 370

Published on Sunday, 5th February 2012, 07:00 am; Solved by 353;
Difficulty rating: 65%

Let us define a *geometric triangle* as an integer sided triangle with
sides a ≤ b ≤ c so that its sides form a **geometric progression**, i.e.
b^2^ = a · c . 

An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides a =
144, b = 156 and c = 169.

There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter ≤ 10^6^ .

How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter ≤ 2.5·10^13^ ?
