The Chase
---------

### Problem 227

Published on Saturday, 10th January 2009, 01:00 am; Solved by 1432;
Difficulty rating: 65%

"*The Chase*" is a game played with two dice and an even number of
players.

The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite
players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die
roll it.\
 If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left;
if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right;
otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn.\
 The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
and passed; that player has then lost.

In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the
game lasts?

Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.
