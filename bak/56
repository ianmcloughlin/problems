Powerful digit sum
------------------

### Problem 56

Published on Friday, 7th November 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 38711;
Difficulty rating: 5%

A googol (10^100^) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred
zeros; 100^100^ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by
two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each
number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, *a^b^*, where *a, b* \< 100,
what is the maximum digital sum?
