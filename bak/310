Nim Square
----------

### Problem 310

Published on Saturday, 13th November 2010, 07:00 pm; Solved by 670;
Difficulty rating: 40%

Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.\
 Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the
players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.\
 The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered
triple (a,b,c).\
 If 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next player
is 1160.

Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0≤a≤b≤c≤100
000.
