### Problem 285

Published on Saturday, 3rd April 2010, 05:00 am; Solved by 785;
Difficulty rating: 55%

Albert chooses a positive integer k, then two real numbers a, b are
randomly chosen in the interval [0,1] with uniform distribution.\
 The square root of the sum (k·a+1)^2^ + (k·b+1)^2^ is then computed and
rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to k, he scores k
points; otherwise he scores nothing.

For example, if k = 6, a = 0.2 and b = 0.85, then
(k·a+1)^2^ + (k·b+1)^2^ = 42.05.\
 The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest
integer, it becomes 6.\
 This is equal to k, so he scores 6 points.

It can be shown that if he plays 10 turns with k = 1, k = 2, ...,
k = 10, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal
places, is 10.20914.

If he plays 10^5^ turns with k = 1, k = 2, k = 3, ..., k = 10^5^, what
is the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal
places?
