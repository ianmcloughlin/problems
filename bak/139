Pythagorean tiles
-----------------

### Problem 139

Published on Saturday, 27th January 2007, 09:00 am; Solved by 3616;
Difficulty rating: 50%

Let (*a*, *b*, *c*) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle
with integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles
together to form a square with length *c*.

For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5
square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by
5 square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.

However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure
7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.

Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred
million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to
take place?
