Published on Sunday, 17th May 2015, 10:00 am; Solved by 597; Difficulty
rating: 20%

5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed
5.\
 5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.\
 Let S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's
totient function Ï†(n) is a Hamming number.\
 S(100)=3728.

Find S(10^12^). Give your answer modulo 2^32^.
