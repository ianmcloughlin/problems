  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  1\
  x
  +
  1\
  y
  =
  1\
  n
  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

For a limit L we define F(L) as the number of solutions which satisfy x
\< y â‰¤ L.

We can verify that F(15) = 4 and F(1000) = 1069.\
 Find F(10^12^).
