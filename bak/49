Prime permutations
------------------

### Problem 49

Published on Friday, 1st August 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 37306;
Difficulty rating: 5%

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms
are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one
another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit
increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
this sequence?
