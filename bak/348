Sum of a square and a cube
--------------------------

### Problem 348

Published on Saturday, 3rd September 2011, 04:00 pm; Solved by 1645;
Difficulty rating: 25%

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of
them in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a
square and a cube, both greater than 1, in **exactly** 4 different
ways.\
 For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in
exactly 4 different ways:

2285^2^ + 20^3^\
 2223^2^ + 66^3^\
 1810^2^ + 125^3^\
 1197^2^ + 156^3^

Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
