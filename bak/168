Number Rotations

### Problem 168

Published on Friday, 16th November 2007, 05:00 pm; Solved by 1723;
Difficulty rating: 65%

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving
the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.\
 It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.\
 This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its
right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 \< n \< 10^100^,
that have this property.
