Cutting rope
------------

### Problem 398

Published on Sunday, 14th October 2012, 08:00 am; Solved by 243;
Difficulty rating: 55%

Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from
each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose m-1
points at random and cut the rope at these points to create m segments.

Let E(n, m) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment. For
example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7. Note that if multiple segments
have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment
is defined as the same as the shortest length.

Find E(10^7^, 100). Give your answer rounded to 5 decimal places behind
the decimal point.
