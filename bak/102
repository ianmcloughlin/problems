Triangle containment
--------------------

### Problem 102

Published on Friday, 12th August 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 14411;
Difficulty rating: 15%

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for
which -1000 ≤ *x*, *y* ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)\
\
 X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas
triangle XYZ does not.

Using [triangles.txt](project/resources/p102_triangles.txt) (right click
and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the
co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of
triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the
example given above.
