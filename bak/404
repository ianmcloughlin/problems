Crisscross Ellipses
-------------------

### Problem 404

Published on Sunday, 2nd December 2012, 01:00 am; Solved by 213;
Difficulty rating: 60%

E~a~ is an ellipse with an equation of the form x^2^ + 4y^2^ = 4a^2^.\
 E~a~' is the rotated image of E~a~ by θ degrees counterclockwise around
the origin O(0, 0) for 0° \< θ \< 90°.

b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest
to the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection
points.\
 We call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a *canonical ellipsoidal triplet*
if a, b and c are positive integers.\
 For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.

Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b,
c) for a ≤ N.\
 It can be verified that C(10^3^) = 7, C(10^4^) = 106 and C(10^6^) =
11845.

Find C(10^17^).
