### Problem 77

Published on Friday, 27th August 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 12201;
Difficulty rating: 25%

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five
different ways:

7 + 3\
 5 + 5\
 5 + 3 + 2\
 3 + 3 + 2 + 2\
 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in
over five thousand different ways?
