Right-angled triangles that share a cathetus
--------------------------------------------

### Problem 176

Published on Friday, 4th January 2008, 05:00 pm; Solved by 1235;
Difficulty rating: 70%

The four right-angled triangles with sides (9,12,15), (12,16,20),
(5,12,13) and (12,35,37) all have one of the shorter sides (catheti)
equal to 12. It can be shown that no other integer sided right-angled
triangle exists with one of the catheti equal to 12.

Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of
exactly 47547 different integer sided right-angled triangles.
