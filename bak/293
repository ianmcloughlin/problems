Pseudo-Fortunate Numbers
------------------------

### Problem 293

Published on Saturday, 22nd May 2010, 05:00 am; Solved by 1787;
Difficulty rating: 30%

An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power
of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.\
 The first twelve admissible numbers are
2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.

If N is admissible, the smallest integer M \> 1 such that N+M is prime,
will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.

For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime
factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.\
 The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate
number for 630 is M=11.\
 It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.

Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible
numbers N less than 10^9^.
