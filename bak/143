Investigating the Torricelli point of a triangle
------------------------------------------------

### Problem 143

Published on Friday, 2nd March 2007, 09:00 pm; Solved by 1651;
Difficulty rating: 65%

Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120
degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q,
and XB = r.

Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q +
r was minimised.

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and
AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed
circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat
point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that
when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and
CO also intersect at T.

If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive
integers we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example,
a = 399, b = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p
+ q + r = 784.

Find the sum of all distinct values of p + q + r â‰¤ 120000 for Torricelli
triangles.
