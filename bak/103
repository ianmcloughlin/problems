Special subset sums: optimum
----------------------------

### Problem 103

Published on Friday, 26th August 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 5004;
Difficulty rating: 45%

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size *n*. We shall
call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B
and C, the following properties are true:

1.  S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2.  If B contains more elements than C then S(B) \> S(C).

If S(A) is minimised for a given *n*, we shall call it an optimum
special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given
below.

*n* = 1: {1}\
*n* = 2: {1, 2}\
*n* = 3: {2, 3, 4}\
*n* = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}\
*n* = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

It *seems* that for a given optimum set, A = {*a*~1~, *a*~2~, ... ,
*a*~n~}, the next optimum set is of the form B = {*b*, *a*~1~+*b*,
*a*~2~+*b*, ... ,*a*~n~+*b*}, where *b* is the "middle" element on the
previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for *n* = 6 to
be A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not
the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a
near optimum set. The optimum set for *n* = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20,
22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for *n* = 7, find its set
string.

NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 105](problem=105) and [Problem
106](problem=106).
