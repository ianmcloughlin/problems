An integer is called *eleven-free* if its decimal expansion does not
contain any substring representing a power of 11 except 1.

For example, 2404 and 13431 are eleven-free, while 911 and 4121331 are
not.

Let E(*n*) be the *n*th positive eleven-free integer. For example, E(3)
= 3, E(200) = 213 and E(500Â 000) = 531563.

Find E(10^18^).
