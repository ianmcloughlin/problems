Circumscribed Circles
---------------------

### Problem 373

Published on Saturday, 25th February 2012, 04:00 pm; Solved by 243;
Difficulty rating: 75%

Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three
vertices. Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of
the circumscribed circle is integral as well.

Let S(n) be the sum of the radii of the circumscribed circles of all
such triangles for which the radius does not exceed n.

S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.

Find S(10^7^).
