Hexagonal orchards
------------------

### Problem 351

Published on Saturday, 17th September 2011, 10:00 pm; Solved by 1531;
Difficulty rating: 25%

A *hexagonal orchard* of order n is a triangular lattice made up of
points within a regular hexagon with side n. The following is an example
of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:

![p351\_hexorchard.png](project/images/p351_hexorchard.png)\

Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by
a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of
order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.

Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal
orchard of order n.

H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.

Find H(100 000 000).
