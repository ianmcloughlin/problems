Special subset sums: meta-testing
---------------------------------

### Problem 106

Published on Friday, 7th October 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 4026;
Difficulty rating: 50%

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size *n*. We shall
call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B
and C, the following properties are true:

1.  S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2.  If B contains more elements than C then S(B) \> S(C).

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains *n* strictly
increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained
from a set for which *n* = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested
for equality (first rule). Similarly, when *n* = 7, only 70 out of the
966 subset pairs need to be tested.

For *n* = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained
need to be tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](problem=103) and [Problem
105](problem=105).
