Chef Showdown
-------------

### Problem 481

Published on Sunday, 21st September 2014, 04:00 am; Solved by 142;
Difficulty rating: 65%

A group of chefs (numbered \#1, \#2, etc) participate in a turn-based
strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a
dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of
judges for taste-testing. Let S(k) represent chef \#k's skill level
(which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability
that chef \#k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on
any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef
must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The
last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.

The game always begins with chef \#1, with the turn order iterating
sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle
repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their
chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other
chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than
one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is
always the one with the next-closest turn.

Define W~n~(k) as the probability that chef \#k wins in a competition
with n chefs. If we have S(1) = 0.25, S(2) = 0.5, and S(3) = 1, then
W~3~(1) = 0.29375.

Going forward, we assign S(k) = F~k~/F~n+1~ over all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, where
F~k~ is a Fibonacci number: F~k~ = F~k-1~ + F~k-2~ with base cases F~1~
= F~2~ = 1. Then, for example, when considering a competition with n = 7
chefs, we have W~7~(1) = 0.08965042, W~7~(2) = 0.20775702, W~7~(3) =
0.15291406, W~7~(4) = 0.14554098, W~7~(5) = 0.15905291, W~7~(6) =
0.10261412, and W~7~(7) = 0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal places each.

Let E(n) represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition
with n chefs. For instance, E(7) = 42.28176050.

Find E(14) rounded to 8 decimal places.
