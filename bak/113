Non-bouncy numbers
------------------

### Problem 113

Published on Friday, 10th February 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7476;
Difficulty rating: 30%

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
a decreasing number; for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor
decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

As *n* increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below *n* increases
such that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not
bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10^10^.

How many numbers below a googol (10^100^) are not bouncy?
