Distances in a bee's honeycomb
------------------------------

### Problem 354

Published on Sunday, 16th October 2011, 07:00 am; Solved by 267;
Difficulty rating: 65%

Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular
hexagon with side length 1.

![p354\_bee\_honeycomb.png](project/images/p354_bee_honeycomb.png)

One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.\
 For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L
from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to
centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to
accommodate for any distance we wish to consider.\
 For example, B(√3) = 6, B(√21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.

Find the number of L ≤ 5·10^11^ such that B(L) = 450.
