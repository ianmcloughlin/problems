### Problem 262

Published on Friday, 30th October 2009, 09:00 pm; Solved by 488;
Difficulty rating: 80%

The following equation represents the *continuous* topography of a
mountainous region, giving the elevation h at any point (x,y):

![p262\_formula1.gif](project/images/p262_formula1.gif)\

A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without
leaving the area given by 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1600.

Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a
point A', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same
elevation f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point
B' directly above B.

First, determine f~min~ which is the minimum constant elevation allowing
such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.\
 Then, find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while
flying at that constant elevation f~min~.

Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.

Note: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated
below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:\
 h=( 5000-0.005\*(x\*x+y\*y+x\*y)+12.5\*(x+y) ) \* exp(
-abs(0.000001\*(x\*x+y\*y)-0.0015\*(x+y)+0.7) )
