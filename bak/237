------------------------------

### Problem 237

Published on Saturday, 21st March 2009, 01:00 pm; Solved by 1046;
Difficulty rating: 70%

Let T(*n*) be the number of tours over a 4 × *n* playing board such
that:

-   The tour starts in the top left corner.
-   The tour consists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one
    square.
-   The tour visits each square exactly once.
-   The tour ends in the bottom left corner.

The diagram shows one tour over a 4 × 10 board:
