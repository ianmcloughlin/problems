Cross-hatched triangles
-----------------------

### Problem 163

Published on Saturday, 13th October 2007, 02:00 am; Solved by 1183;
Difficulty rating: 70%

Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the *size 1*
triangle in the sketch below.

![](project/images/p163.gif)

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
location can now be observed in that triangle. Using *size 1* triangles
as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the *size 2*
triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either
different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed
in that *size 2* triangle.

It can be observed that the *size 2* triangle contains 4 *size 1*
triangle building blocks. A *size 3* triangle would contain 9 *size 1*
triangle building blocks and a *size n* triangle would thus contain
*n^2^ size 1* triangle building blocks.

If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of
*size n*, then

T(1) = 16\
 T(2) = 104

Find T(36).
