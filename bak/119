### Problem 119

Published on Friday, 7th April 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 8097;
Difficulty rating: 30%

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its
digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8^3^ = 512. Another
example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28^4^.

We shall define *a*~n~ to be the *n*th term of this sequence and insist
that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that *a*~2~ = 512 and *a*~10~ = 614656.

Find *a*~30~.
