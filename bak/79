Passcode derivation
-------------------

### Problem 79

Published on Friday, 17th September 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 29534;
Difficulty rating: 5%

A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for
three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode
was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the
expected reply would be: 317.

The text file, [keylog.txt](project/resources/p079_keylog.txt), contains
fifty successful login attempts.

Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse
the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of
unknown length.
