Almost equilateral triangles
----------------------------

### Problem 94

Published on Friday, 29th April 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7713;
Difficulty rating: 35%

It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
length sides and integral area. However, the *almost equilateral
triangle* 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an *almost equilateral triangle* to be a triangle for
which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one
unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all *almost equilateral triangles*
with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed
one billion (1,000,000,000).
