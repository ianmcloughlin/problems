Prime cube partnership

There are some prime values, *p*, for which there exists a positive
integer, *n*, such that the expression *n*<sup>3</sup> + *n*<sup>2</sup>*p* is a perfect
cube.

For example, when *p* = 19, 8<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup>Ã—19 = 12<sup>3</sup>.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this
property the value of *n* is unique, and there are only four such primes
below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
