We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p<sup>2</sup>q<sup>3</sup>, where p
and q are distinct primes.\
 For example, 200 = 5<sup>2</sup>2<sup>3</sup> or 120072949 = 23<sup>2</sup>61<sup>3</sup>.

The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.

Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change
any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers,
prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous
sub-string "200" is 1992008.

Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string
"200".
