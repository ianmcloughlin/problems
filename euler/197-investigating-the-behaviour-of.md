Given is the function f(x) = ⌊2<sup>30.403243784-x<sup>2</sup></sup>⌋ × 10<sup>-9</sup> ( ⌊ ⌋ is
the floor-function),\
 the sequence u<sub>n</sub> is defined by u<sub>0</sub> = -1 and u<sub>n+1</sub> = f(u<sub>n</sub>).

Find u<sub>n</sub> + u<sub>n+1</sub> for n = 10<sup>12</sup>.\
 Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.
