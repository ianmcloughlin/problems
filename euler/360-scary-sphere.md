Given two points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>) in three
dimensional space, the **Manhattan distance** between those points is
defined as\
 |x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>|+|y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>|+|z<sub>1</sub>-z<sub>2</sub>|.

Let C(r) be a sphere with radius r and center in the origin O(0,0,0).\
 Let I(r) be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the
surface of C(r).\
 Let S(r) be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of I(r)
to the origin O.

E.g. S(45)=34518.

Find S(10<sup>10</sup>).
