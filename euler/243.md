A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is
called a proper fraction.\
 For any denominator, d, there will be d−1 proper fractions; for
example, with d = 12:\
<sup>1</sup>/~12~ , <sup>2</sup>/~12~ , <sup>3</sup>/~12~ , <sup>4</sup>/~12~ , <sup>5</sup>/~12~ , <sup>6</sup>/~12~ ,
<sup>7</sup>/~12~ , <sup>8</sup>/~12~ , <sup>9</sup>/~12~ , <sup>10</sup>/~12~ , <sup>11</sup>/~12~ .

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a *resilient
fraction*.\
 Furthermore we shall define the *resilience* of a denominator, R(d), to
be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example,
R(12) = <sup>4</sup>/~11~ .\
 In fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) \<
<sup>4</sup>/~10~ .

Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) \<
<sup>15499</sup>/~94744~ .
