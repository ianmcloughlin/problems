Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

*x*<sup>2</sup> – D*y*<sup>2</sup> = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in *x* is 649<sup>2</sup> –
13×180<sup>2</sup> = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when
D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in *x* for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain
the following:

3<sup>2</sup> – 2×2<sup>2</sup> = 1\
 2<sup>2</sup> – 3×1<sup>2</sup> = 1\
9<sup>2</sup> – 5×4<sup>2</sup> = 1\
 5<sup>2</sup> – 6×2<sup>2</sup> = 1\
 8<sup>2</sup> – 7×3<sup>2</sup> = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in *x* for D ≤ 7, the largest
*x* is obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of *x* for which the
largest value of *x* is obtained.
