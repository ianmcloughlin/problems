In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  1\
  x
  +
  1\
  y
  =
  1\
  n
  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions
and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct
solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds four million?

**Note:** This problem is a much more difficult version of [Problem
108](problem=108) and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute
force approach it requires a clever implementation.
