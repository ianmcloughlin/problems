A positive integer n is **powerful** if p<sup>2</sup> is a divisor of n for every
prime factor p in n.

A positive integer n is a **perfect power** if n can be expressed as a
power of another positive integer.

A positive integer n is an **Achilles number** if n is powerful but not
a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 =
2<sup>5</sup>·3<sup>3</sup> and 1800 = 2<sup>3</sup>·3<sup>2</sup>·5<sup>2</sup>.

We shall call a positive integer S a *Strong Achilles number* if both S
and φ(S) are Achilles numbers.<sup>1</sup>\
 For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: φ(864) = 288 = 2<sup>5</sup>·3<sup>2</sup>.
However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: φ(1800) = 480 =
2<sup>5</sup>·3<sup>1</sup>·5<sup>1</sup>.

There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 10<sup>4</sup> and 656 below 10<sup>8</sup>.

How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 10^18^?

<sup>1</sup> φ denotes **Euler's totient function**.
