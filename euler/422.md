Let H be the hyperbola defined by the equation 12x<sup>2</sup> + 7xy - 12y<sup>2</sup> =
625.

Next, define X as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that X is in H.

Now we define a sequence of points in H, {P~i~ : i ≥ 1}, as:

-   P~1~ = (13, 61/4).
-   P~2~ = (-43/6, -4).
-   For i \> 2, P~i~ is the unique point in H that is different from
    P~i-1~ and such that line P~i~P~i-1~ is parallel to line P~i-2~X. It
    can be shown that P~i~ is well-defined, and that its coordinates are
    always rational.

You are given that P~3~ = (-19/2, -229/24), P~4~ = (1267/144, -37/12)
and P~7~ = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784).

Find P~n~ for n = 11^14^ in the following format:\
If P~n~ = (a/b, c/d) where the fractions are in lowest terms and the
denominators are positive, then the answer is (a + b + c + d) mod
1 000 000 007.

For n = 7, the answer would have been: 806236837.
