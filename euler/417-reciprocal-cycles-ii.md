A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation
of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

>   ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
>   <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>                  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>                  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
>   =                        =                        = 
>   0.5                      0.(3)                    0.25
>   ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It
can be seen that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2
and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.\
 We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as
0.

Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n. You are given
that ∑L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.

Find ∑L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 000
