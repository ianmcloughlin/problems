The sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201 ...\
 is defined by T<sub>1</sub> = T<sub>2</sub> = T<sub>3</sub> = 1 and T<sub>n</sub> = T<sub>n-1</sub> + T<sub>n-2</sub> +
T<sub>n-3</sub>.

It can be shown that 27 does not divide any terms of this sequence.\
In fact, 27 is the first odd number with this property.

Find the 124<sup>th</sup> odd number that does not divide any terms of the above
sequence.
