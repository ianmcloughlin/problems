Let x~1~, x~2~,..., x~n~ be a sequence of length n such that:

-   x~1~ = 2
-   for all 1 \< i ≤ n : x~i-*1*~ \< x~i~
-   for all i and j with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n : (x~i~) <sup>j</sup> \< (x~j~ + 1)<sup>i</sup>

There are only five such sequences of length 2, namely: {2,4}, {2,5},
{2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.\
 There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given
below:\
 {2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.

Let t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n.\
 You are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.

Find t(10^10^) and give your answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>.
