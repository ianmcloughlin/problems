Let f~5~(n) be the largest integer x for which 5<sup>x</sup> divides n.\
 For example, f~5~(625000) = 7.

Let T~5~(n) be the number of integers i which satisfy f~5~((2·i-1)!) \<
2·f~5~(i!) and 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\
 It can be verified that T~5~(10<sup>3</sup>) = 68 and T~5~(10<sup>9</sup>) = 2408210.

Find T~5~(10^18^).
