Given the positive integers, *x*, *y*, and *z*, are consecutive terms of
an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, *n*,
for which the equation, *x*<sup>2</sup> − *y*<sup>2</sup> − *z*<sup>2</sup> = *n*, has exactly two
solutions is *n* = 27:

34<sup>2</sup> − 27<sup>2</sup> − 20<sup>2</sup> = 12<sup>2</sup> − 9<sup>2</sup> − 6<sup>2</sup> = 27

It turns out that *n* = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten
solutions.

How many values of *n* less than one million have exactly ten distinct
solutions?
