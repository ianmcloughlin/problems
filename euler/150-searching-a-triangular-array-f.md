In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find
a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the
smallest possible.

In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle
satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.

We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we
generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers s<sub>k</sub> in the range ±2<sup>19</sup>, using a
type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential
Generator) as follows:

t := 0\
 for k = 1 up to k = 500500:\
     t := (615949\*t + 797807) modulo 2<sup>20</sup>\
     s<sub>k</sub> := t−2<sup>19</sup>

Thus: s<sub>1</sub> = 273519, s<sub>2</sub> = −153582, s<sub>3</sub> = 450905 etc

Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers
thus:

s<sub>1</sub>\
 s<sub>2</sub>  s<sub>3</sub>\
 s<sub>4</sub>  s<sub>5</sub>  s<sub>6</sub> \
 s<sub>7</sub>  s<sub>8</sub>  s<sub>9</sub>  s<sub>10</sub>\
 ...

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as
far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the
next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and
so on).\
 The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements
it contains.\
 Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.
