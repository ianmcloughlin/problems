Consider the set I<sub>r</sub> of points (x,y) with integer co-ordinates in the
interior of the circle with radius r, centered at the origin, i.e. x<sup>2</sup>
+ y<sup>2</sup> \< r<sup>2</sup>.

For a radius of 2, I<sub>2</sub> contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1),
(0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight
triangles having all three vertices in I<sub>2</sub> which contain the origin in
the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from
these by rotation.

For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the
interior and having all vertices in I<sub>3</sub> and for I<sub>5</sub> the number is
10600.

How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and
having all three vertices in I<sub>105</sub>?
