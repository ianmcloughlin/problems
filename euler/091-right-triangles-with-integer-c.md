The points P (*x*<sub>1</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>) and Q (*x*<sub>2</sub>, *y*<sub>2</sub>) are plotted at
integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can
be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that
is,\
0 ≤ *x*<sub>1</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>, *x*<sub>2</sub>, *y*<sub>2</sub> ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ *x*<sub>1</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>, *x*<sub>2</sub>, *y*<sub>2</sub> ≤ 50, how many right
triangles can be formed?
