Consider the consecutive primes *p*<sub>1</sub> = 19 and *p*<sub>2</sub> = 23. It can be
verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are
formed by *p*<sub>1</sub> whilst also being divisible by *p*<sub>2</sub>.

In fact, with the exception of *p*<sub>1</sub> = 3 and *p*<sub>2</sub> = 5, for every pair
of consecutive primes, *p*<sub>2</sub> \> *p*<sub>1</sub>, there exist values of *n* for
which the last digits are formed by *p*<sub>1</sub> and *n* is divisible by
*p*<sub>2</sub>. Let *S* be the smallest of these values of *n*.

Find ∑ *S* for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ *p*<sub>1</sub> ≤
1000000.
