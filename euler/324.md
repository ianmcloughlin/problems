Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3×3×n tower with
blocks of 2×1×1.\
You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however,
rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.

For example (with q = 100000007) :\
f(2) = 229,\
f(4) = 117805,\
f(10) mod q = 96149360,\
f(10<sup>3</sup>) mod q = 24806056,\
f(10<sup>6</sup>) mod q = 30808124.

Find f(10^10000^) mod 100000007.
