Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68. It can be shown that
this triangle has area 9.

S(n) is the sum of the areas of all triangles with sides √(1+b<sup>2</sup>),
√(1+c<sup>2</sup>) and √(b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an
integral area not exceeding n.

The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.

S(10<sup>6</sup>)=18018206.

Find S(10^10^).
