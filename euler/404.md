E~a~ is an ellipse with an equation of the form x<sup>2</sup> + 4y<sup>2</sup> = 4a<sup>2</sup>.\
 E~a~' is the rotated image of E~a~ by θ degrees counterclockwise around
the origin O(0, 0) for 0° \< θ \< 90°.

b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest
to the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection
points.\
 We call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a *canonical ellipsoidal triplet*
if a, b and c are positive integers.\
 For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.

Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b,
c) for a ≤ N.\
 It can be verified that C(10<sup>3</sup>) = 7, C(10<sup>4</sup>) = 106 and C(10<sup>6</sup>) =
11845.

Find C(10^17^).
