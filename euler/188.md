The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer
b, denoted by a↑↑b or <sup>b</sup>a, is recursively defined by:\
\
 a↑↑1 = a,\
 a↑↑(k+1) = a^(a↑↑k)^.

Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 3<sup>3</sup> = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 3^27^ = 7625597484987
and 3↑↑4 is roughly 10^3.6383346400240996\*10\^12^.

Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.
