A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: P~0~, P~1~, P~2~ and
P~3~.

The curve is constructed as follows:\
 On the segments P~0~P~1~, P~1~P~2~ and P~2~P~3~ the points Q~0~,Q~1~
and Q~2~ are drawn such that\
 P~0~Q~0~ / P~0~P~1~ = P~1~Q~1~ / P~1~P~2~ = P~2~Q~2~ / P~2~P~3~ = t (t
in [0,1]).\
 On the segments Q~0~Q~1~ and Q~1~Q~2~ the points R~0~ and R~1~ are
drawn such that\
 Q~0~R~0~ / Q~0~Q~1~ = Q~1~R~1~ / Q~1~Q~2~ = t for the same value of t.\
 On the segment R~0~R~1~ the point B is drawn such that R~0~B / R~0~R~1~
= t for the same value of t.\
 The Bézier curve defined by the points P~0~, P~1~, P~2~, P~3~ is the
locus of B as Q~0~ takes all possible positions on the segment
P~0~P~1~.\
 (Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.)

At [this (external) web
address](http://home.kpn.nl/hklein/bezier/bezier.html) you will find an
applet that allows you to drag the points P~0~, P~1~, P~2~ and P~3~ to
see what the Bézier curve (green curve) defined by those points looks
like. You can also drag the point Q~0~ along the segment P~0~P~1~.

From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent
to the segments P~0~P~1~ in P~0~ and P~2~P~3~ in P~3~.

A cubic Bézier curve with P~0~=(1,0), P~1~=(1,v), P~2~=(v,1) and
P~3~=(0,1) is used to approximate a quarter circle.\
 The value v \> 0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines
OP~0~, OP~3~ and the curve is equal to <sup>π</sup>/~4~ (the area of the quarter
circle).

By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length
of the quarter circle?

  That is, if L is the
  length of the curve,
  calculate 100 ×
  L − π/2
  π/2

Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
