The positive integers, *x*, *y*, and *z*, are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression. Given that *n* is a positive integer, the
equation, *x*<sup>2</sup> − *y*<sup>2</sup> − *z*<sup>2</sup> = *n*, has exactly one solution when
*n* = 20:

13<sup>2</sup> − 10<sup>2</sup> − 7<sup>2</sup> = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of *n* below one hundred for which
the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of *n* less than fifty million have exactly one
solution?
